        <h5 class="bg2-head">The Space</h5>
        <p class="bg2-para">Space is the expanse that exists beyond Earth and its atmosphere and between celestial bodies. It is not completely empty; it is a near-perfect vacuum containing a low density of particles, predominantly a plasma of hydrogen and helium as well as electromagnetic radiation, magnetic fields, neutrinos, dust, and cosmic rays.</p>
        <p class="bg2-para">The volume of interplanetary space is a nearly total vacuum, with a mean free path of about one astronomical unit at the orbital distance of the Earth. This space is not completely empty, and is sparsely filled with cosmic rays, which include ionized atomic nuclei and various subatomic particles. There is also gas, plasma and dust, small meteors, and several dozen types of organic molecules discovered to date by microwave spectroscopy. A cloud of interplanetary dust is visible at night as a faint band called the zodiacal light. Interplanetary space contains the magnetic field generated by the Sun.</p>
        <p class="bg2-para">The Solar System is a vast region of space that is home to the Sun, eight planets, their moons, and many other objects. The planets orbit the Sun in a nearly circular path, and the moons orbit their planets in a similar way. The Solar System is also home to comets, asteroids, and dust.</p>
        <p class="bg2-para">The Milky Way is a spiral galaxy that is home to our Solar System. It is about 100,000 light-years across and contains billions of stars. The Milky Way is part of a group of galaxies called the Local Group, which also contains the Andromeda Galaxy and the Triangulum Galaxy.</p>
        <p class="bg2-para">The universe is the vast expanse of space that contains all of the galaxies, stars, planets, and other objects. It is estimated to be about 13.8 billion years old and to contain trillions of galaxies.</p>
        <p class="bg2-para">Humanity has been studying space for centuries, and our understanding of it has grown exponentially in recent decades. We have sent probes to explore the Solar System, and we have even sent astronauts to the Moon. We are still learning about space, but we are making great progress in our understanding of this vast and mysterious place.</p>
