# HTML

Hey their, I am happy that you read my HTML ReadMe file.
This HTML repositorie consist of basic HTML and CSS code for developing minimal view of 
webpage by exploring multiple HTML 5 tags.

Here I hosted lot of mini-HTML project that helps to understand the HTML 5 and CSS 3 
easily. Most of the files consist of in-line CSS styling. So, you no need to wory about 
switching the file for observing the code. But in future I create seperate CSS file for
styling to reduce the complixity of the code.
